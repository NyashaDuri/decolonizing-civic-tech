<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen we see free software—and we have a very long free software culture/movement—we always think of freedom of assembly freedom of speech, instead of freedom of cost, because we know that freedom is never free of cost. Our parents’ generation, our grandparent’s generation, paid dearly for it and we need to use software freedoms to keep it free.</p>
